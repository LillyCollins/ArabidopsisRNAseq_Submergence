**Section 3.1.3 WT and GABA mutants' transcriptional response to submergence**

This repository contains code and results in the analysis for chapter 3 of my PhD thesis, specifically in subsection 3.1.3 WT and GABA mutants' transcriptional response to submergence. Output results of GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were in the "_Results" folder.
